    This model predicts the **gold price per gram in INR** based on the current **USD to INR exchange rate**.
    Built using **Random Forest Regressor** trained on real world financial data (2024-2025).
    
    **Note:**  
    - This model achieves around **85%** accuracy using USD-INR rates.
    - However, gold prices are influenced by multiple economic and seasonal factors such as crude oil prices, inflation, stock market trends, festivals, and taxes.
